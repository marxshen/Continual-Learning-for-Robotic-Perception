# Continual Learning for Robotic Perception

The program replaces BVLC with ResNet-50 to perform continual learning on CORe50, a dataset and benchmark for continual learning (CL), object detection and segmentation. CL concerns new training patterns in later batches and tackling new classes w/o losing accuracy on previous ones.



Project Option: CORe50

Environment: Colab Pro - Google Colab

The highest accuracy for classification at object level (50 classes) with ResNet-50: 0.821533333333333
