# Continual Learning for Robotic Perception

---
This program replaces BVLC CaffeNet with ResNet-50 to perform Continual Learning (CL) strategies on the CORe50 dataset.

CL concerns new training patterns in later batches and tackling new classes without losing accuracy on previous ones.

From the benchmarks for classification at object level (50 classes), the accuracies of the classification are increased up to 25.11%.

Project Option: CORe50

Environment: Colab Pro - Google Colab

The highest accuracy for classification at object level (50 classes) with ResNet-50: 0.821533333333333
